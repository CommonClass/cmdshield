# cmdshield
CmdShield is a simple, batch file obfuscator. It helps protect Windows batch files (.bat) by renaming variables, masking individual characters, and reconstructing strings using variable references. It can also obfuscate numbers to make your scripts harder to read at a glance.

Features:
Renames variables to random, unreadable names
Masks characters and rebuilds strings using variables
Obfuscates numbers with math expressions
Adds a layer of protection against casual reverse engineering
